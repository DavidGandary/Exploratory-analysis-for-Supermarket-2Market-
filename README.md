Exploratory analysis and presenting insights for 2Market Supermarket(In depth technical report can be found in [01 Project Management](01%20Project%20Management/)

## Project description
The project aimed to help a global supermarket(2Market) which sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour. 

In particular, 2Market wanted to understand:

- The demographics of their customers
- Which advertising channels seemed to be the most effective
- Which products seemed to sell the best and if that varied based on demographic
## Data Sources(s)
Provided was two data files, marketing_data.csv and ad_data.csv. Which were found in a ZIP file to be downloaded. Alongside the two CSV files was also the metadata. The metadata was a text file that described the columns and variables in the data files.
## Research Questions
Analysis focused on asking several questions both of key stakeholders as well as the data
### Questions to ask stakeholders
- Does the general market price for certain products differ from 2Markets products if so by how much and why?
- Where does focus after insights are obtained lie; higher selling products or lower selling products or both?
### Questions to ask the data 
- Is there a relationship between certain products and advertising engagement?
- What products sell the best?
## Tableau Dashboard
The results of our analysis have been synthesised into an interactive dashboard hosted on Tableau Public, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring the findings and recommendations. The dashboard includes three interactive bar charts. 
## **Challenges and Solutions**

Faced challenges with data variability and missing values. Addressed these issues through data cleaning and balancing techniques, which allowed for accurate comparisons across age groups and marital statuses.

## **End Results and Recommendations**

### **Strategic Recommendations**

- **Target Customer Loyalty Programs in Spain**: Given Spain's high market share, prioritise customer loyalty strategies in this region.
- **Explore Advertising Efficacy**: With Twitter performing well in multiple countries (e.g., Spain, South Africa, India), allocate more resources to Twitter ads, particularly in these regions.
- **Adjust Pricing Strategy for Alcohol Beverages**: Given their popularity, particularly among 41–50-year-olds, consider gradual price increases to maximise revenue without compromising demand.
- **Address unique market needs:** Region-specific strategies were proposed, particularly for high-potential markets like Montenegro. For this market, metrics like ad impressions and click-through rates could guide ad spend efficiency, enhancing reach and engagement.

## **Outcomes**

This analysis provided actionable insights into age-based preferences and region-specific advertising platforms, enabling more targeted customer engagement strategies across different demographics.

## **Reflections**

This project highlighted the importance of aligning product marketing strategies with customer demographics and showcased SQL’s utility in extracting and segmenting critical data for insights. Recognition of the importance of a structured problem-solving approach, which I plan to implement in future projects. This structured approach would help guide the analysis systematically and ensure it addresses both strategic and technical objectives, particularly for technical audiences.

## **Next Steps**

Future analysis could explore the relationship between lead conversions and total spend per channel. This would offer insights into the efficiency of different marketing channels and allow us to fine-tune ad spend based on customer conversion effectiveness. Additionally, analysing income distributions across top-purchasing age groups for premium product offerings may uncover more pricing opportunities.
